## The Transcendentals:

### The True:

- Fairness metrics:
  - Schedule reversal: flight $f_1$ is originally scheduled to arrive before $f_2$, but then then the schedule changes such that $f_2$ is scheduled to arrive first.

### The Good:

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) usage will be increasing significantly in the next decade. This increase will require both tactical (real-time) and strategic (minutes to hours in advance) scheduling. This paper explores the tradeoffs between fairness and efficiency in such a scheduling space, and finds that fairness can be improved with little loss in efficiency.

### The Beautiful:


## Other important details:

## Acronyms:
- **ATFM**: Air Traffic Flow Management
- **UAS**: Unmanned Aircraft Systems
